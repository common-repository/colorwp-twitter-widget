Adds a Twitter widget to be used in your theme sidebar. Customizable number of latest tweets and design.

== Description ==

**NEW:** Now supporting the new Twitter API v1.1 (API 1.0 is retired and old requests will get a "Cannot get latest tweets" message; It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of the plugin to take advantage of the advanced features).

The Twitter Widget plugin for WordPress will allow you to add an unlimited amount of widgets in your sidebar, each showing a customizeable number of tweets from a specific user.

*NOTE: Due to some recent restrictions from Twitter, you must now create a Widget in your Twitter profile (under Settings->Widgets), before the tweets are visible in your WordPress widget.*
To create a new widget, [click here](https://twitter.com/settings/widgets/new "Create a new Twitter widget"), create the widget and copy/paste the generated HTML code in the WordPress widget from this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your /wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the Wordpress admin dashboard.
3. Go to Appearance -> Widgets to see the new widget and move it in your sidebar.
